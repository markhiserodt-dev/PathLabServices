          With the whole world being affected by Covid, we wanted to do our part in any way we can to help relieve the stress it has caused. That is why we started offering Covid tests.
          We were one of the first labs in Southern California to offer Covid-19 testing, and have been a leader in delivering these tests. Our Covid tests are 99.9% accurate and results delivered within a few days.
